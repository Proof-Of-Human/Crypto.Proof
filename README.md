# Crypto.Proof
The simplest & most unobstrusive proof: Someone uses a "Wallet Plugin" they actually hold a certain threshold of investment & have held value in this wallet for some time - Ideally it's their Primary or secondary (Anonymous) cyrpto wallet), Final step They "make a 1 satoshi transaction" to a Social Network's verfication smart contract! With a challenge response message!
